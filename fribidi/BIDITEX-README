BiDiTeX Notes
=============

The libfribidi was changed in order to compile in win32 platform.

This is stripped version of fribidi library. It does
not include all the original files. It includes only the
files that are used in biditex

Source Code changes
===================
FRIBIDI_API definitiom in file fribidi_config.h was changed
to empty for WIN32 due to compilation problems.
