BiDiTeX Notes
=============

The libfribidi was changed in order to compile in win32 platform.

This is stripped version of fribidi library. It is used
for cross compilation to win32 platform using mingw32 compiler.

FRIBIDI_API definitiom was changed to empty for WIN32 due to 
compilation problems
